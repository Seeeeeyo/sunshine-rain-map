1. Project Overview
The website will display the hours of sunshine and rain for specific places around the world. Users can search for a place, visualize it on a map with color-coded indicators for rain and sunshine, navigate the map, and view a leaderboard of the best places based on sunshine and rain data.

2. Features
Search and Visualization

Users can search for a specific place.

The place is highlighted on the map with color-coded indicators for sunshine and rain.

Map Navigation

Users can navigate the map to explore different regions.

Interactive map controls for zooming and panning.

Leaderboard

A list of the best places based on sunshine and rain data.

Display rankings with place names and corresponding data.

3. Requirements for Each Feature
Search and Visualization

Implement a search bar for place input.

Integrate a mapping library (e.g., Leaflet, Google Maps).

Use color-coded markers or overlays to represent sunshine and rain data.

Example: Green for sunshine, blue for rain.

Map Navigation

Ensure smooth zooming and panning functionality.

Provide map controls for user interaction.

Display tooltips or popups with detailed data when a place is clicked.

Leaderboard

Create a table or list to display the top places.

Include columns for place name, sunshine hours, and rain hours.

Allow sorting by sunshine or rain hours.

4. Data Models

7. Error Handling
If a place is not found, display a user-friendly message.

Handle errors in data fetching and map rendering gracefully.

8. Security
Data Storage:

Encrypt sensitive data.

Implement data access controls.

9. Performance Optimization
Optimize map rendering for performance.

Use lazy loading for data and images.

10. User Interface
Intuitive design for search and map interaction.

Clear visual indicators for sunshine and rain data.

11. Testing Strategy
Unit Tests: For data models and search functionality.

Integration Tests: For map and leaderboard integration.

UI Tests: For user interface responsiveness and usability.

12. Documentation
Clear guidelines for setting up the development environment.

Codebase documentation for ease of understanding and maintenance.

13. Future Scalability
Design the system to accommodate real-time data integration.

Consider modular architecture for easy expansion.
